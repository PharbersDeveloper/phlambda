 * the user's beforeSave/beforeRender functions when it calls them.
 *
 * @param {TransformMode} mode Whether the resulting function should transform
 *   its input using the registry's beforeSave functions or its beforeRender ones.
 * @param {Extras} extras A number of extra objects that are either needed to
 *   make the returned function (e.g. the resource type registry) or are passed
 *   by that function to the user's beforeSave/beforeRender for convenience.                                  [description]
